### The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. I'm recode the function printf(). I'm mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments

- How to use    
  - Include this repository at you project and initialize the library "ft_printf.h" to use the functions, after that just have fun!! ðŸŽ‰
